# Î—CI Frontend App

Frontend app that we are implementing in the context of an assigment for **Human Computer Interaction** 2022 class, **MSc Advanced Computer & Telecommunications Systems** in **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki**

### Quick Overiew of the functionality
This app is intended to be used by elderly people. So we assured that the UI is based on neurtral colors that elder people with visibility problems can distinguise easily. Further more we decided images for buttons that an elder person can understand by heart without thinking.

- Profile: Informations that an elder person can access easily like his name, home address, telephone and his civilian ID
- Contacts: Telephone numbers (at most 6) that the user can add and call them easily with one click
- Camera: Open the Camera easily with one click
- Google Maps: Open the Google Maps easily with one click and locate the person
- Added Functionality: Detect big accelerations that might be impacts and notify the contact that is assigned as Emergency Contact
